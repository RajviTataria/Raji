        <br><h3>Procedure (to make the manchurian balls):</h3>
    
  
    <ol>
    <li>Heat oil for frying in a wok or fryer.</li><br>
    <li>Place the veggies and the rest of the ingredients in the bowl and mix until a ball formed with the veggies holds together. You don't want the balls to be doughy. So, add only if necessary.</li><br>
    <li>Shape the mixture into ¾-inch balls and fry.</li><br>
    <li>Turn the manchurian balls over as needed so they are golden-brown on both sides. Remove them to a dish lined with paper towels and set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><h3>Procedure (to make the gravy manchurian):</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>To make the sauce, place the wok on high heat and when it is very hot, pour the oil in along the sides of the pan.</li><br>
    <li>Add the garlic and stir-fry for just 10 seconds or so, then immediately add in the bell peppers and onion. Saute just a minute, then add the sauces one by one: the ketchup, soy sauce, hot chili sauce, vinegar  and the paste. Mix together quickly and then add four cups of vegetable broth to the wok and add salt according to taste. Bring to a boil.</li><br>
    <li>Mix the cornstarch with 4 tbsp water and add a little at a time until the sauce thickens. You don't have to use all of it, just add it until the sauce becomes as thick as your liking. Cook the sauce until it comes to a boil and becomes glossy, 2-4 minutes. Add the manchurian balls. Turn off heat and season with scallions/spring onion before serving.</li><br>
    <li>Serve it with Fried/Schezwan rice.</li><br>
    <li>Enjoy!!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <br><h3>Procedure (to make the dry manchurian):</h3>
    <Ol>
        <li>Now heat the sesame oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot add finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies.</li><br>
        <li>Then, add the onion and cook till they are soft and translucent or light pink.</li><br>
        <li>Now add ketchup, hot chilli sauce, soy sauce, vinegar and the paste and mix well.</li><br>
        <li>now add constarch slurry and let it simmer for 2 minutes or till you get nice thick of sauce. Make sure it is not watery. Now add salt and pepper to taste. You can add red chilli flakes too. Mix well.</li><br>
        <li>Now add the fried manchurian balls. Toss them and coat all the balls with that sauce. Lastly sprinkle scallions/spring onions greens and serve immediately.</li><br>
